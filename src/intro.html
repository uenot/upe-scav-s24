    <h1>Welcome to your first challenge of the Spring 2024 UPE Scavenger Hunt!</h1>
    <h3>This website is an "API maze": you'll need to search through it to find the clue to your next location.</h3>
    <p>Some guidelines:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The maze begins at route "/maze/start".</li>
        <li>Each page in the maze tells you the next destination.</li>
        <ul>
            <li>e.g. if "/maze/start" contains the string "next", you would then want to check "/maze/next".</li>
            <li>Try this in your browser a couple times!</li>
        </ul>
        <li>There are 5,000 pages in the maze.</li>
        <ul>
            <li>So you could go through them all manually... but that would take a long time!</li>
        </ul>
        <li><b>CAVEAT</b>: I'm hosting this on a free service, so if you are responsible for hitting the request limit and crashing the API, 
            everyone else will advance and your team will go last!</li>
        <li>If everyone on your team is stumped, ask an EBoard memberâ€” we'll point you in the right direction.</li> 
    </ul>
    <p>Good luck!</p>
